# Stock Risk and Return Analysis
This project explores the risk and return characteristics of three companies — Johnson & Johnson, Ford, and Microsoft — using Python. The goal was to practice data analysis and financial metrics while building skills in Jupyter Notebook, pandas, matplotlib, and yfinance.

## Objectives
- Download and process stock price data (2015–2025)
- Calculate daily returns, cumulative returns, volatility, and Sharpe Ratios
- Visualize stock performance with price trends, cumulative returns, and rolling volatility graphs
- Compare companies on both raw performance and risk-adjusted performance

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python** (data analysis and calculations)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (interactive coding environment)  
- **pandas** (data manipulation)  
- **matplotlib** (data visualization)  
- **yfinance** (stock market data retrieval)

## Key Insights
- Microsoft showed the strongest growth and the best risk-adjusted returns  
- Ford was the most stable but also had weaker overall performance  
- Johnson & Johnson was steady but produced the lowest returns relative to risk

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/ashirai/python-stock-analysis.git
3. Install the required packages:
   pip install pandas matplotlib yfinance
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to reproduce the analysis

## Learning Outcome
This project improved my skills in:
- Working with financial data  
- Applying statistical and financial concepts (volatility, returns, Sharpe Ratio)  
- Using Python libraries for real-world data projects  
- Structuring and documenting code for GitHub
